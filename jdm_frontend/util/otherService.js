A frequently asked question is whether or not JDM can recoup “drawback,” or duty already paid to Customs for exported cargo. The answer is “whenever possible!”
Our staff is well aware that this is an important consideration for many importers/exporters, which is why we specialize in duty refunds for goods that have been marked for export following a period within the U.S. commerce system. If your business needs include drawback claims for manufactured, rejected, or unused merchandise, the need for accelerated drawback payment, waiver of prior notice of intent to export, or one-time waiver of prior notice of intent to export, JDM’s team will bring their expertise to bear on the issue and generate the best possible results.
